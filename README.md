3. **What's new ->** Stimulus JS is used in this web Application for Drag and Drop. Stimulus is a JavaScript framework.Stimulus is designed to enhance        static or server-rendered HTML—the “HTML you already have”—by connecting JavaScript objects to elements on the page using simple annotations.
     These JavaScript objects are called controllers, and Stimulus continuously monitors the page waiting for HTML data-controller attributes to appear.      For each attribute, Stimulus looks at the attribute’s value to find a corresponding controller class, creates a new instance of that class, and          connects it to the element.
